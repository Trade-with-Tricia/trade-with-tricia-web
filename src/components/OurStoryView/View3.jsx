                        Trade with Tricia traces its origins to the fall of 2016, when founder Cole Preece started his journey
                        in the University of Portland Entrepreneur Scholars program. The program helps a group of students
                        start ventures throughout the year with the help of industry mentors. Every good venture starts with
                        a pressing problem, and the problem that Cole brought to his mentor for brainstorming was the problem
                        of textbooks on campus. Even with a myriad of options, there was still no easy way for students to buy
                        and sell books between each other on campus. His mentor, Brad Gauthier, brought an emerging trend to his
                        attention that might offer a novel and compelling approach to solving the problem—chatbots.

                        All of the other ways to trade books required apps to be downloaded or long forms to be completed—way
                        too much work for the average college student. Months of user and industry research ensued, culminating
                        in pitching the project to be a Computer Science Senior Capstone Project in the Shiley School of
                        Engineering during the spring of 2017. The pitch was successful, and Tricia’s dream team was born
                        shortly thereafter.

                        Starting in the fall of 2017 ‘Team Tricia’ got to work: Avaya, Charles, Jared, Michael, and Nathan,
                        with the guidance of Cole and faculty advisor Steve Vegdahl. The team has now designed something very
                        few CS teams, (much less student CS teams) have done before: full-stack developing an entire service
                        and user experience with nothing more than responses to text messages.
